# SDKs

This directory contains reusable SDKs (Software Development Kits) used across the organization.

## Purpose

This is the central location to store SDKs for 3rd party services, especially in cases where the provider does not offer an official SDK but provides an API.

## SDK Generation

We utilize the [APIdog](https://apidog.com/) application to generate these SDKs from API specifications. This ensures consistency and rapid development when integrating with external services.

## Responsibility

This folder is responsible for holding the SDKs that are utilized by various services and applications within the organization's ecosystem.
